## Project Plan 
  1) Environment Setup: First, we will setup environment for our project using tools like VMware Workstation, Nessus Essentials and Windows 10 
  2) Old and Vulnerable Software Install: Then after initial scan we will install vulnerable and old Firefox to later compare the vulnerabilities 
  3) Vulnerability Scanning: We will do total four vulnerability scan to find different scan result and then compare all of them to give us better understanding 
  4) Risk Identification: We will review the results from scan to see what we can do to remediate it later 
  5) Remediating the Risk: We remediate most of the software related vulnerabilities just by updating them to latest versions

• Click on “Create a new Scan” in Nessus, then select “Basic Network Scan” 

<p align="left"><img width="1000" height="150" src="https://github.com/mitesh72925/Vulnerability-Management-Lab/blob/main/Images/Screenshot%202024-08-29%20224455.png"></p> 

• Since we are just running our first scan as basic, we are going to only provide the IP address to check how many vulnerabilities we will find by just network scanning 

<p align="left"><img width="1000" height="400" src="https://github.com/mitesh72925/Vulnerability-Management-Lab/blob/main/Images/Screenshot%202024-08-29%20224456.png"></p>

• Now save the information and go back to “My Scan” page to start the first scan 

<br>

## First Scan 

• As you can see that in our first scan, we only found 1 Medium, 1 Low vulnerabilities 

<p align="left"><img width="1000" height="500" src="https://github.com/mitesh72925/Vulnerability-Management-Lab/blob/main/Images/Screenshot%202024-08-29%20224457.png"></p>

• Now we will setup our VM for Credentialed Vulnerability scan 

<br>

### Setup up VM for Credentialed Vulnerability Scan 

To do this we need to make some changes 
  1) We need to open “Services” app and then Enable “Remote Registry” by right clicking it and go to properties. In startup type select “Automatic”, then “apply”, then “start” and click “ok” 

<p align="left"><img width="1000" height="500" src="https://github.com/mitesh72925/Vulnerability-Management-Lab/blob/main/Images/Screenshot%202024-08-29%20224458.png"></p>

  2) Now search and open “User Account control setting” and set it to “Never Notify” then click “ok” 

<p align="left"><img width="1000" height="500" src="https://github.com/mitesh72925/Vulnerability-Management-Lab/blob/main/Images/Screenshot%202024-08-29%20224459.png"></p>

  3) Then search and open “Advanced Sharing settings” and confirm that “File and Printer sharing” is On 

<p align="left"><img width="1000" height="500" src="https://github.com/mitesh72925/Vulnerability-Management-Lab/blob/main/Images/Screenshot%202024-08-29%20224460.png"></p>

  4) Now search and open “Registry Editor” as Administrator 

  • Go to “Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System” this path 

  • Now right click on empty space and select “NEW”, then “DWORD (32-bit) Value” to create new value 

<p align="left"><img width="1000" height="500" src="https://github.com/mitesh72925/Vulnerability-Management-Lab/blob/main/Images/Screenshot%202024-08-30%20000616.png"></p> 

  • Now, name it “LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy” and then right click it to modify it and change its value to “1” 

 <p align="left"><img width="1000" height="500" src="https://github.com/mitesh72925/Vulnerability-Management-Lab/blob/main/Images/Screenshot%202024-08-30%20000758.png"></p>

• Now you need to go back to Nessus and then check box our VM and then click on “more” option on right, then click “configure”. Then select “Credentials” option and then “Windows” to fill-up the VM login info 

<p align="left"><img width="1000" height="500" src="https://github.com/mitesh72925/Vulnerability-Management-Lab/blob/main/Images/Screenshot%202024-08-30%20000928.png"></p> 

<br>

<p align="left"><img width="1000" height="500" src="https://github.com/mitesh72925/Vulnerability-Management-Lab/blob/main/Images/Screenshot%202024-08-30%20001022.png"></p>

<br> 

### Second Scan 

• Now start the second scan and wait for the result 

<p align="left"><img width="1000" height="500" src="https://github.com/mitesh72925/Vulnerability-Management-Lab/blob/main/Images/Screenshot%202024-08-30%20001044.png"></p>

• Now you will see more Vulnerabilities than our first scan, the reason is that now Ness have deep access to the system to run deep scan for vulnerabilities 

<br> 

### Installing old and vulnerable Firefox on VM 

• Go to the link provided and download deprecated version of Firefox and install it. [Click here](https://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/3.6.12/win32/en-US/) 

<p align="left"><img width="1000" height="500" src="https://github.com/mitesh72925/Vulnerability-Management-Lab/blob/main/Images/Screenshot%202024-08-30%20002239.png"></p>

<br>

### Third Scan 

• This time you will see more vulnerabilities than first and second time because of installing vulnerable Firefox, which has so many different CVE linked to it. 

<p align="left"><img width="1000" height="500" src="https://github.com/mitesh72925/Vulnerability-Management-Lab/blob/main/Images/Screenshot%202024-08-30%20012121.png"></p>

<br>

### Remediation by updating Systems and Software 

• To remediate, we need to update some apps. After updating apps, we will be able to remediate most of the vulnerabilities. 

<p align="left"><img width="1000" height="1000" src="https://github.com/mitesh72925/Vulnerability-Management-Lab/blob/main/Images/Screenshot%202024-08-30%20012122.png"></p>

• Things to update for this computer: 

  1) Firefox 

  2) Microsoft Edge 

  3) Apps update from Microsoft Store 

  4) Update Windows system as well.  

<br>

### Fourth Scan 

• In our Fourth scan you will find out that most of our vulnerabilities has been removed by updating all software and system 

<p align="left"><img width="1000" height="500" src="https://github.com/mitesh72925/Vulnerability-Management-Lab/blob/main/Images/Screenshot%202024-08-30%20015343.png"></p>

• After this remediation if you want to go little further then you can look for their solutions for remaining vulnerabilities. You can follow steps they mention or you can google the solutions for that those vulnerabilities using the CVE number. 

<br>

## Conclusion 

This project on vulnerability management involved setting up a Windows 10 virtual machine with outdated software, followed by a detailed vulnerability assessment using VMware Workstation Player. Vulnerability scans identified security weaknesses, which were then remediated to reduce risks. A credentialed scan provided a more accurate assessment, showing that remediation efforts effectively decreased vulnerabilities. The project emphasized the importance of proactive vulnerability management, regular assessments, and timely remediation in enhancing the security of systems and networks.
